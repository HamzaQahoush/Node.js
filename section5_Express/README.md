# Express js :

framework (set of function and tools , rules help us to build our app)
we want to focus on our applicaltion.

- alternative :

1. vanilla Node js
2. Adonis .
3. sails.

• To install Express.js `npm i --save express ` not dev because it's production dependencey.

• express js all about middleware , incoming requests is auto funneled through bunch of functions. use multiple functions and send responses

• we used body parser because `request` does not parse incoming request body.

• use `npm i --save body-parser` to add it .

• `use ` work with all http methods , `get` , `post` use as filter .
